# Autonomous Giving Platform Specifications

**Platform Specification v1.1** · Status: proposed canon · Owner: Autonomous Giving Incorporated

## Mission

Provide the authoritative, implementation-neutral definition of the Autonomous Giving Platform: how needs become verified impact through governed, attributable allocations. The [Platform Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md) is the highest-order normative document.

## Purpose and boundaries

This repository owns platform architecture, contracts, schemas, lifecycle, terminology, design standards, ADRs, and deterministic demo behavior. It contains **no application code, deployable API, frontend, backend, or infrastructure**. Implementation repositories consume immutable, versioned artifacts from here and link back rather than duplicating platform architecture.

## Architecture

The platform converts an observed `Need` into an auditable `Impact` through a canonical lifecycle. Intelligence may discover and recommend; governance authorizes; execution performs; evidence proves. See [SPEC-005](specs/SPEC-005-lifecycle.md) and the [lifecycle diagram](diagrams/lifecycle.md).

**Logical architecture** (capabilities) and **physical deployment** are independent. Fund Intel, Autonomous Giving, and Impact Relay are capabilities—not mandatory separate deployables. See [SPEC-002A](specs/SPEC-002A-architectural-principles.md) and [SPEC-006](specs/SPEC-006-capability-boundaries.md).

## Reference deployment

The **recommended MVP** is a modular monolith (Profile B). Capabilities stay separate in code; deployment stays unified.

| Profile | Intent |
| --- | --- |
| A Demo | Static fixtures, no backend |
| **B MVP** | **Recommended:** one app, one database, modular capabilities |
| C Production | Optional scale-out of the same modular unit |
| D Enterprise | Optional extraction, streaming, multi-region |

Full detail: [SPEC-020 Reference Deployment Profiles](specs/SPEC-020-reference-deployment-profiles.md) and [implementation guidance](docs/implementation-guidance.md).

**No Kubernetes, event broker, or service mesh is required for a conformant MVP.**

## Executable validation

```bash
pip install -r requirements-validation.txt
python validation/validate_all.py
```

This command is the merge gate: it validates metadata, references, schemas, examples, lifecycle, ownership, terminology, conformance manifests, and the Community AI Lab demo fixture. See [validation/README.md](validation/README.md).

Machine-readable indexes for portals and explorers live under [`generated/`](generated/). Consumer conformance examples: [`conformance/examples/`](conformance/examples/). Pin a release package from `dist/` (built by `python validation/package_release.py`).

## Contribution workflow

1. Open or update a SPEC before changing a normative contract.
2. Record material architectural choices as an ADR using the Nygard format.
3. Update affected schemas, events, glossary terms, examples, and references in one change.
4. Run `python validation/validate_all.py` (must report `PASS`); see [validation](docs/validation.md).
5. Obtain review from the listed owner and one consuming implementation repository.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the required change and review process.

## Versioning

Platform releases use semantic versioning. A major version may change a required contract or lifecycle invariant; a minor version adds backward-compatible authority; a patch clarifies without changing normative behavior. Details: [SPEC-012](specs/SPEC-012-versioning.md).

## Implementation repositories

[Portofolio-Signals](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Portofolio-Signals) (Fund-Intel / Portfolio Signals), Impact Relay, and Autonomous Giving Incorporated implement these artifacts as **capabilities** (optionally co-located). They must identify the consumed specification version, validate produced messages against the linked schema, and retain platform references in their own documentation.

The [implementation consumption guide](docs/implementation-consumption.md) and [implementation guidance](docs/implementation-guidance.md) define adoption and the modular-monolith-first path.

Runtime evidence lives in implementation repos — especially Portofolio-Signals [`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Portofolio-Signals/blob/main/docs/CURRENT-STATE.md) — not here. See [implementation progress](docs/superpowers/IMPLEMENTATION-PROGRESS.md).

### Allocation middleware (informative)

Client product direction: transaction-light pots → allocate → proof → packet (canonical connector **every.org**). Design and plans live under `docs/superpowers/`. First implementation: [Portofolio-Signals `services/allocation-middleware/`](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Portofolio-Signals/tree/main/services/allocation-middleware) (Hacker Dojo pilot seed; live webhook operator-owned). This specs repo remains free of application code.

### Suite commercial onboarding (informative)

People (C) → client shell (B) → document pack → second tenant (D) → allocation pilot. Document pack phase 1 **code** is on Portofolio-Signals main (#104); platform OBSERVED still operator. HD data login-gated; Ed is HD director only. Continuation: [suite continuation plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-08-suite-continuation.md). Hub: [SUITE-ONBOARDING.md](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Portofolio-Signals/blob/main/docs/SUITE-ONBOARDING.md).
